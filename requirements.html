                    <h1>Requirements Analysis</h1>
                    <p>Defining the foundation for our sensory-friendly educational platform through comprehensive requirement gathering and analysis.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="context">Context & Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional tablets create sensory overload for students with autism through bright screens and visual distractions. SEN schools need distraction-free learning technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students needing help must wait for teacher attention, losing patience and focus. Teachers cannot assist multiple students simultaneously, creating learning gaps and disengagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing educational technology either lacks AI personalization or uses distracting devices. Cloud-based solutions violate school privacy requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manuscripta addresses this through dual applications: teachers generate AI-powered content on Windows laptops and distribute to students' E-ink tablets over local Wi-Fi. Monochromatic displays minimize sensory overload, handwriting recognition provides immediate feedback, and real-time monitoring helps teachers identify struggling students. Discreet help buttons enable assistance requests without class disruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                This decouples AI content creation from consumption while maintaining on-premises privacy and reducing cognitive load for neurodiverse learners.
            </p>

            <h2 id="aims">Project Aims</h2>
            <p>
                Our primary goal is to create a classroom orchestration system that reduces distraction while empowering teachers with AI-driven content creation tools. Specifically, we aim to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce Classroom Disruption:</strong> Deliver educational content on monochromatic E-ink displays that minimize audiovisual distractions, creating focused learning environments particularly beneficial for neurodivergent students.</li>
                <li><strong>Empower Teacher Orchestration:</strong> Enable teachers to generate, customize, and distribute AI-powered lesson materials (text summaries, quizzes, worksheets) to up to 30 student devices simultaneously over a local network.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Diverse Learning Needs:</strong> Provide accessibility features including adjustable reading levels, text-to-speech, content simplification, and real-time feedback to support students with varying cognitive abilities and learning styles.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable Bidirectional Engagement:</strong> Create a two-way system where students can submit quiz responses and request help discreetly, allowing teachers to monitor progress and identify struggling students in real-time through an anonymized dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure Privacy and Security:</strong> Operate entirely on-premises with no cloud dependencies, maintaining full student data privacy through anonymization and compliance with data protection regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Demonstrate Real-World Impact:</strong> Validate the system through user testing with over 100 students at specialist SEN schools and present findings at the BETT education technology conference.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="research">User Interviews</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted stakeholder consultations through semi-structured interviews to validate requirements and understand user needs.

                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Mixture. Currently, we mostly use iPads and some Windows tablets, which allow for a variety of access needs, including touch with accommodations, stylus, head tracking, mouse and eye-gaze.</p>

                        <p>The distinction between "Worksheet" and "Quiz" requires visual clarification beyond text descriptions. Teachers need immediate visual cues to differentiate content types when creating and distributing materials.</p>

                        <p>A simple difficulty slider is insufficient due to subjectivity in difficulty perception. The AI should conduct an initial cohort assessment during course setup, with teachers able to override slider settings via textual descriptions for more nuanced control.</p>

                        <p><strong>On-Device AI Requirements</strong></p>
                        <p>The teacher application must use on-device AI processing via OpenVINO and Qualcomm Snapdragon technologies to maintain privacy compliance. No cloud-based AI processing is permitted for student data. All handwriting recognition, content generation, and assessment must occur locally on the teacher's Windows laptop.</p>

                        <p><strong>Handwriting Recognition Capabilities</strong></p>
                        <p>The system must accurately parse multiple input types from returned PDFs: tick boxes for multiple-choice questions, handwritten text answers, and annotated diagrams. AI processing should handle varying handwriting quality across age groups (11–18) and provide automated feedback to teachers on student responses.</p>

                        <p>AI capabilities should include text summarisation for struggling readers, content translation for multilingual students, and reading level adjustment. These features support diverse cognitive abilities and language backgrounds in SEN classrooms.</p>

                        <p>The reMarkable tablet demonstration revealed screen mirroring capabilities useful for teacher-led instruction. The system should support real-time display of teacher content for whole-class demonstrations while maintaining distraction-free student experiences.</p>

                        <p>Professor Mohamedally emphasised creating a "microdrive" model where student notes persist throughout their education as personal property. The AI should adapt to evolving handwriting patterns from early childhood, building personalised assessment history without cloud dependencies. Students own and control their educational materials.</p>

            <p>
                We developed personas based on our stakeholder consultations and research into neurodiverse learning needs. These personas represent our primary user groups: students with autism and sensory sensitivities who benefit from distraction-free E-ink displays, and teachers who need efficient tools to generate and distribute educational content.
