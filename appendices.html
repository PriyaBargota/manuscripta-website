                <h3>Week 1</h3>

                <div class="subcard subcard--orange">
                    <h4>Project Briefing</h4>
                    <p>This week, we were assigned the <strong>Manuscripta project</strong> for the Systems Engineering module, working with <strong>IBM</strong> (a technology company providing AI tools) and <strong>Qualcomm</strong> (a company that makes computer chips).</p>
                    <p>Over the next 2 terms, we'll be developing an educational system for classrooms. The general idea involves teachers using technology to create and share learning materials with students on special low-distraction screens.</p>
                    <p>We will cover every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle, from gathering requirements and designing user interfaces to testing and presenting the final application.</p>
                    <p>Over the past week, we got to know our teammates and received our initial project brief from Prof. Dean Mohamedally. We've scheduled meetings with our clients for next week to gather specific requirements and clarify exactly what we'll be building. In the meantime, our team has begun researching the technologies we might use.</p>

                <div class="subcard subcard--blue">
                    <h4>First Team Meeting</h4>
                    <p>After receiving the details of our project and team members, we set up our communication and collaboration tools:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>WhatsApp</strong> for quick day-to-day communication</li>
                        <li><strong>GitHub</strong> for code repository and version control</li>
                        <li><strong>In-person meetings</strong> scheduled after our weekly labs while feedback from TAs is fresh</li>
                        <li><strong>Zoom</strong> for remote meetings when needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Team organisation went well, and everyone is on the same page when it comes to our working values: showing respect, being proactive with required work, and communicating clearly. We've also prepared several general questions to ask our clients during next week's meeting. So far, it looks like we will work well as a team.</p>

                <div class="subcard subcard--green">
                    <h4>Research Assignments &amp; Proposed Roles</h4>
                    <p>Although the exact scope and requirements of the project are still being clarified with our clients, we have identified clear areas that will definitely require research and experimentation regardless of the final direction. To prepare effectively and align with our strengths and interests, we've assigned each team member a research area and proposed role:</p>
